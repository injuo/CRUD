"11 January 2023 The Insurance Authority (IA) today (11 January 2023) published its Annual Report 2021-22 bearing the title of â€œSpearheading Balanced Development and Sustainable Growthâ€. â€œMandated by statute to facilitate sustainable development and promote competitiveness of the industry, the IA strives to ensure that insurance fulfils, first and foremost, a social role of risk mitigation while spurring economic growth,â€ said Mr Stephen Yiu, Chairman of the IA. The annual report gives an overview of key activities carried out by the IA to forge Hong Kong into a global risk management centre and regional insurance hub by leveraging on the â€œdual circulationâ€ strategy. On domestic circulation, the IA is cooperating closely with relevant Mainland authorities on implementation of the unilateral recognition policy for motor vehicle insurance and setting up of after-sales service centres in selected Mainland cities of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. On international circulation, issuance of two catastrophe bonds under the regulatory regime for insurance-linked securities and designation of three insurance groups under the group-wide supervision framework exemplified the crucial role of Hong Kong as a super connector between the Mainland and the rest of the world. â€œAlthough the IA is vested with a broad spectrum of statutory powers to investigate and impose disciplinary sanctions on suspected cases of misconduct, equal priority is placed on joint surveillance with other regulators and public education with industry bodies. By doing so, we strive to deliver the intrinsic value of insurance by bridging protection gaps and deepening financial inclusion,â€ said Mr Clement Cheung, Chief Executive Officer of the IA. Key measures taken by the IA in the reporting year to further protection of policy holders include revamping of the complaints handling system, launching of a joint Mystery Shopping Programme on tax-deductible insurance products, strengthening of the Continuing Professional Development requirements and stepping up of enforcement actions. Riding on the first Mortality Protection Gap Study, publicity campaigns were introduced on lifetime risk profiling, fulfilment ratios, participating policies and digital onboarding to impart useful knowledge to the community. The annual report also highlights notable progress achieved on major projects such as the Risk-based Capital Regime and the Policy Holdersâ€™ Protection Scheme, as well as the drive on green and sustainable finance and digital transformation. The general public is welcomed to access full and simplified versions of the Annual Report 2021-22, together with an animation of its major contents, from theÂ IA website. Ends  ",test1
"10 January 2023 The Insurance Authority (IA) has taken disciplinary action against a former insurance agent who used two different false academic certificates on two separate occasions to establish that she met the minimum education requirements to be an insurance agent under the previous self-regulatory regime. The case was handled in accordance with the requirements in place at the time the false academic certificates were submitted. The former agent has been prohibited from applying to be licensed for 3 years. The former agent first used a false academic certificate in October 2015 when she applied to be registered as an insurance agent of an authorized insurer with the Insurance Agents Registration Board (IARB). In December 2015, the former agent then used a different false academic certificate to apply to the IARB to be registered as an insurance agent of a different authorized insurer. Both academic certificates were purported to have been issued by schools which the former agent had never attended. The former agent used these false academic certificates, despite the fact that she had actually satisfied the minimum academic requirements to be an insurance agent (having attended a different school to those stated in the two false academic certificates she submitted). Insurance agents are required to act ethically and to have integrity as a basic standard of professionalism, as members of the public place trust in them by relying on their advice and recommendations on insurance matters. An individual, who displays such a lack of ethics and integrity by using false academic certificates on two separate occasions in a submission to a regulator, violates the trust on which the insurance market must be founded. Such individual is deserving of a lengthy ban. It matters not that she satisfied the minimum academic requirements. This is an issue that goes to character and knowingly submitting false documents to a regulator twice is indicative not only of a lack of fitness and properness of character, but also a material lack of understanding of the duties and ethical responsibilities of an insurance agent. The IA continues to have zero tolerance for this and individuals who sought to utilise false academic certificates under the previous self-regulatory regime will not be considered fit and proper persons until they are able to establish that they have undergone such a complete reformation of character as to prove that their integrity has been restored. As indicated, this case had to be handled in accordance with the transitional arrangements in Schedule 11 of the Insurance Ordinance (Cap. 41) (the Ordinance), which required the relevant requirements in place at the time to be applied and the disciplinary approach of the IARB1Â to be followed. Hence a three-year prohibition was imposed. The current regulatory regime for licensed insurance intermediaries which came into force on 23 September 2019 has strengthened the punishment for submission of false academic certificates in the licensing process. It is now a criminal offence to provide false information to the IA in connection with an application for a licence or an approval under the Ordinance2. An individual who commits such offence, if found guilty, will be liable to a fine at level 53Â and to imprisonment for 6 months. The IA will have no hesitation in prosecuting any individual who seeks to submit a false academic certificate to the IA as part of the licensing process. Insurers also have a part to play in ensuring that, as part of their recruitment and on-boarding processes for new insurance agents, they carry out adequate checks on the accuracy of the information being submitted to the IA as part of a licensing application by their prospective new insurance agent. For further information on the IAâ€™s enforcement work, please see the â€œEnforcement Newsâ€ section of the IAâ€™s website. Public disciplinary actions against licensed insurance intermediaries may also be searched on the Register of Licensed Insurance Intermediaries on our website. Ends Notes: 1Â Pursuant to section 113(4)(d) of Schedule 11 to the Ordinance, in handling non-compliance cases unresolved by the Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs), the IA may impose a disciplinary sanction on a specified person that could have been imposed by the SRO concerned had the case been handled by the body. 2Â Section 64ZZE of the Ordinance sets out the offence to provide false information in connection with application for licence or approval. 3Â Pursuant to Schedule 8 to the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Cap. 221), a fine at level 5 is HK$50,000 at present.

"30 December 2022 The Insurance Authority (IA) today (30 December 2022) welcomed the third issuance of insurance-linked securities (ILS) in Hong Kong, a catastrophe bond amounting to US$32.5 million (equivalent to about HK$253 million) sponsored by PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited via a special purpose insurer titled Great Wall Re Limited to provide coverage for earthquake risks in China. â€œThe arrival of a second ILS issued in Hong Kong by major Mainland insurance groups reinforces our crucial role as a risk management centre, serving unique needs of the country while offering full and open access by the rest of the world. As efforts are stepped up to increase the number and variety of ILS issuances, a vibrant ecosystem comprising key players on the value chain will soon take shape in Hong Kong,â€ said Mr Clement Cheung, Chief Executive Officer of the IA. â€œThe IA will sustain collaboration with industry stakeholders to realise different goals set out in the Development Roadmap for the Insurance Sector in Hong Kong and elevate our global competitiveness as an international finance centre,â€ he added. This issuance is eligible for the Pilot ILS Grant Scheme rolled out by the Government in May 2021, which offers up to HK$12 million for each application. Ends  ",test3
